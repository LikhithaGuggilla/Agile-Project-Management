# **WellnessPulse - App Development using Agile Methodologies**

WellnessPulse is a simulated Agile project focused on managing the end-to-end project lifecycle for a health and wellness tracking application. The scope included defining a structured product backlog with prioritized user stories, implementing story point estimation for effort assessment, and developing an iterative value roadmap to align with project objectives. Agile best practices were applied to create sprint planning frameworks, backlog refinement strategies, and wireframes, ensuring a structured approach to project execution. Additionally, sprint retrospectives and risk assessments were conducted to enhance decision-making, optimize workflow efficiency, and drive continuous improvement.
